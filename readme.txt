JPEGER beta version 0.4

If you want to run JPEGER without rebuilding the source, the only
file you need is JPEGER.EXE.  All other files can be deleted.  Please
note that at this point in time, because so much functionality is
still missing, running JPEGER is almost useless unless it is for
development purposes.

If you want to help in the JPEGER project, please send me e-mail
so we can figure out how to co-ordinate all of our efforts.

To rebuild JPEGER, you'll need to:

- make certain you're using IBM VisualAge C++ v3.x for OS/2

- unzip jpeger_source.zip, making certain to preserve the long
  filenames and the directory structure

- change to the jpeg_6a subdirectory, and run the script "build.cmd"

- change back to the original directory, and run "nmake -f makefile"
